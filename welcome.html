    <div class="who-we-are">GradeCam is a grading website designed for professors to make grading students' 
      assignments less time consuming and more efficent. A professor uploads his answer key on his profile page and the
      student will upload their assignment on their student page. Using Python and Javascript, we were able to
      compare the professor's answer key to the student's submission and it gets graded.
